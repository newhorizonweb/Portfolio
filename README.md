## Protfolio Project - Tech Details

This Vue-powered project is a playground of creativity and innovation.
It features an animated background and smooth fade-in animations, demonstrating that even the simplest elements can be engaging. The goal was to craft a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design while keeping things understandable. 

Building on experiences from previous projects, this portfolio website became a platform for experimentation and skill enhancement.
Explore the code and uncover how simplicity can be beautiful and engaging.

### Navigation

A simple, fixed navigation with uniquely animated icons.
The mobile version has an interesting feature - there is a close-button cursor proximity indicator. When the user is closer to the close button, the indicator changes to occupy more navigation border spa.
It's a nice, visually appealing feature that enhances the navbar's interactivity and engagement.

### Hero Section

A parallax hero section containing an animated name and a dev icon with outlines that are animated on page load, similar to a loading animation.

The section includes an auto-scroll feature that automatically navigates to the "About Me" section. During this transition, the outlines are "unloaded" as the section fades away.

### Modals

The modals pop out from their exact position on the page, resembling the stretching of a tile to cover the entire page.
The tile modals contain various projects.

The Web Dev projects include a mockup that can be toggled to resemble a desktop or mobile version of the project. It's a screenshot that can be scrolled like a regular website. Additionally, there is information about the project, the tech stack, and links to the GitHub repository, as well as the hosted project.

The Graphic Design Modals are galleries featuring grids of images, including logos, flyers, icons, and color palettes.
Each image can be opened in a full-screen mode.

### Contact Form

The form uses an external mail API (currently Formspree) to handle submissions since GitHub Pages do not support backend.
There are multiple checks, such as verifying empty required fields, validating email addresses, and bot prevention.

There is a popup providing useful information about the current action, such as successful or failed, sumbission, too many attempts, etc.
If the API response takes too long, the user will be notified via the popup.

### Animations

Many parts of the website are animated to introduce visually appealing design and interactivity.

The background includes animated blobs that constantly move and bounce off the edges of the screen (inspired by the legendary DVD Screensaver).
The navigation features icons, each with a unique hover animation.

The hero section has a parallax effect, along with a name outline "loading" animation.
The main sections gracefully fade in as the user scrolls down the page.
